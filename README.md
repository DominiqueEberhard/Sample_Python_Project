# Sample_Python_Project
With this sample project, I made a youtube bot that opens up a random browser on my machine and plays a varying amount of one of my music videos. It is important to note that I made the project such that the view time is short enough to not count as a view on YouTube, so as to avoid any ethical quandaries. I have never actually deployed the project with the intention to get fake YouTube views. However, this was the first kind of project that came to mind when I decided I wanted to experiment with automation.
